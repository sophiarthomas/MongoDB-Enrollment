# Educational Database Management System
## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an advanced Educational Database Management System (EDMS) designed to enhance data storage, retrieval, and analysis for academic institutions. The system leverages MongoDB to implement efficient embedding and referencing techniques. The system is built using MongoDB and operates entirely from the command line, providing a straightforward interface for managing various academic records.

## Features
Command-Line Interface: A dynamic menu system that allows users to navigate through different options and perform actions directly from the command line.
Database Management: Efficient handling of academic records using MongoDB.
User-Friendly Prompts: Clear and concise prompts to guide users through the system.

## Lessons Learned: 
Throughout the development of the EDMS, numerous valuable lessons were learned. One key takeaway was the importance of designing a flexible database schema that can adapt to changing requirements. Additionally, the project highlighted the significance of thorough testing and validation to ensure data integrity and system reliability. The experience also reinforced the value of collaboration and effective communication within the development team, which were crucial in overcoming challenges and achieving project milestones.
